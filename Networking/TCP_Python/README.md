# TCP Example in Python
## Description
The server awaits data from the client. Once data is received from the client, the server sends a reply back to the client.

## Usage
1. Run `Server.py` in a terminal.
1. Then, run `Client.py` in a different terminal.

## Codebase
`Common.py` is a module that contains IP address and port configurations used by both the `Client.py` and `Server.py` modules.
