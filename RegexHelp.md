| **Grouping and Capturing** | **Description** |
| r'\b' | Word boundary special character (r is needed in Python to avoid confusion with the backspace character) |
| () | Capture a group |
| ? | Optionally capture this group |
| \1 | Matches the same text as previously matched by the first capturing group |
| (?\|regex1\|regex2) | Known as a 'branch reset group' that matches one of these groups or nothing |
| (\2two|(one))+ | Forward reference that creates a backreference to a regex that would appear later; matches 'oneonetwo' |
| | |
| | |
| **Lookahead** | **Description** |
| a(?!b) | Negative lookahead to notate that 'a' cannot be followed by 'b' |
| a(?=b) | Positive lookahead to notate that 'a' must be followed by 'b' |
| (?<=a)b |  Positive lookbehind to notate that 'a' must precede 'b' |
| (?<!a)b | Negative lookbehind to notate that 'a' cannot precede 'b' |

## Edge Cases
* `(b?)o\1`
    * Successfully matches 'o' because the backreference matches the nothing captured by the group
* `(b)?o\1`
    * In most regex flavors (excluding JavaScript), this regex pattern fails to match 'o' because the backreference references a group that did not participate in the match at all
